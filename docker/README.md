# Running with Docker

## Building an image

Building a server image

```bash
$ cd ./docker
$ docker build -t <name>:<tag> server
```

## Docker compose

You can start a MAGE server by using [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/) to start services
defined in MAGE's [Compose file](docker-compose.yml).

The first time you run MAGE with docker, execute the following steps from the directory where you cloned the
MAGE Git repoistory.

```bash
$ cd ./docker
$ docker-compose up -d # build the service images, then create and start the service containers for the first time
```

With all the default settings, you should then be able to browse to http://localhost:4242 to interact with the MAGE web app.

## Interacting with the containers

_NOTE:_ All of the following `docker-compose` commands described below assume you are operating from the
[`docker`](docker) directory.

After the initial `up` command, you can use `docker-compose stop` and `docker-compose start` to stop and start the service
containers.

You can use [`docker-compose ps`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/ps/) to see the state of the MAGE service containers.
```bash
$ docker-compose ps
        Name                      Command               State             Ports
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
docker_mage-db_1       docker-entrypoint.sh mongo ...   Up       0.0.0.0:27017->27017/tcp
docker_mage-server_1   node ./app.js                    Up       0.0.0.0:4242->4242/tcp
```
You can use [`docker-compose logs <service>`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/logs/) to display console logging for a service.
```
$ docker-compose logs mage-server
mage-server_1  | 2018-04-26T23:30:30.684Z - info: Starting MAGE Server ...
mage-server_1  | 2018-04-26T23:30:31.403Z - info: setting up provision uid

mage-server_1  | 2018-04-26T23:30:31.861Z - info: Using '/var/lib/mage/icons' as base directory for MAGE icons.
# etc., etc.
```
While the service containers are up, you can interact with them using [`docker-compose exec`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/reference/exec/)
to run commands in the container.  For example, to get an interactive shell session in the MongoDB container, run
```
$ docker-compose exec mage-db bash

## Details

### App Services

The MAGE Server Docker app consists of three service containers: the MongoDB
database, the MAGE Node.js app, and the optional nginx TLS reverse proxy.

### MongoDB
The MongoDB image is the official MongoDB image available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/).  The Compose
file builds that image unmodified, but uses a custom command to launch MongoDB with specific settings.  The Compose file
runs MongoDB as the service `mage-db`.

### MAGE Server
The Compose file references a custom, local [Dockerfile](server/Dockerfile) based on the official [Node.js](https://hub.docker.com/_/node/)
image to build the MAGE server image.  At build time, the MAGE server Dockerfile downloads an archive of the MAGE server
code from [Github](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server).  This defaults to some (hopefully) recent release version of
the MAGE server, e.g., 6.0.0.  The Dockerfile accepts an [argument](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#arg),
`MAGE_VERSION`, which you can specify to `docker-compose` like
```bash
MAGE_VERSION=develop docker-compose build
```
to build with whatever version of MAGE server you wish.  Github should accept any valid, uniquely identifiable refspec in
the download URL the Docker file uses, so you could use a branch name, tag name, or commit hash.  By way of the
```yaml
image: "mage-server:${MAGE_VERSION:-6.0.0}"
```
entry the Compose file tells Docker to [tag](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/part2/#tag-the-image) the `mage-server`
image with value of `MAGE_VERSION`.

Be aware that every different value you specify for `MAGE_VERSION` to `docker-compose build`, Docker will build a separate
`mage-server` image because changing that value modifies the [build stage](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/multistage-build/)
that downloads the MAGE server baseline.  For example after running
```bash
$ MAGE_VERSION=6.0.0 docker-compose build
# ... Docker build output
$ MAGE_VERSION=develop docker-compose build
# ... Docker build output
```
then listing your Docker images ...
```bash
$ docker images
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
mage-server         6.0.0               877f79a739b7        8 minutes ago       949MB
mage-server         develop             75a73b7b7c3e        2 days ago          961MB
node                8.11.1              4635bc7d130c        3 weeks ago         673MB
mongo               3.6-jessie          5b1317f8158f        6 weeks ago         366MB
```
... note you now have two `mage-server` images with different version tags, both occupying over 900MB, and both connecting
to the same MongoDB instance.  In some cases you may actually want to do this, to test an upgrade, for example.  Remember
you can always remove images you don't need.
```bash
$ docker rmi mage-server:develop
```
Another consequence of building the images using the `MAGE_VERSION=xxx docker-compose build` syntax is that you must then
supply the same `MAGE_VERSION=xxx` value when you run the subsequent `docker-compose up -d` command.  Otherwise, `docker-compose`
will rebuild the `mage-server` image with the version the Compose file defines if it differs from the one you specified on
the command line, and run a container with that version instead.

### HTTPS/TLS Reverse Proxy
Then `mage-web-proxy` service is optional when developing and running on
localhost, but highly recommended when running MAGE Server on publicly
accessible servers.  The service in `docker-compose.yml` uses the official
nginx docker image with an appropriate [configuration](web/nginx.conf).  This
is an example of setting up a reverse proxy in front of the Node server to
enforce HTTPS/TLS connections to the server.  Of course, you could use any
reverse proxy you see fit, such as [Apache HTTP Server](https://httpd.apache.org/)
or an AWS [Application Load Balancer](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/introduction.html).  To run your MAGE server behind the TLS
reverse proxy, peform the following modifications to `docker-compose.yml`.
1. Comment the `ports` block for the `mage-server` service to disallow
  connections directly to the Node.js server.
1. Uncomment the block with the `mage-web-proxy` service key.

For testing in a development environment, you can create a self-signed server
certificate for nginx to use.  The following OpenSSL command, run from the
directory of this README, will create a self-signed server certificate and
private key in the `web` directory that should allow the MAGE mobile app to
connect to nginx.  Replace the values of the `SUBJ_*` variables at the
beginning of the command with your own values.
```
SUBJ_C="XX" \
SUBJ_ST="State" \
SUBJ_L="Locality" \
SUBJ_O="Organization" \
SUBJ_OU="Organizational_Unit" \
SUBJ_CN="HOST_NAME_OR_IP"; \
openssl req -new -nodes -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -sha256 -days 1095 \
-out web/mage-web.crt -keyout web/mage-web.key \
-config <(cat /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf <(printf "[mage]\n  \
subjectAltName=DNS:$SUBJ_CN\n  \
basicConstraints=CA:true")) \
-subj "/C=$SUBJ_C/ST=$SUBJ_ST/L=$SUBJ_L/O=$SUBJ_O/OU=$SUBJ_OU/CN=$SUBJ_CN" \
-extensions mage; \
unset SUBJ_C SUBJ_ST SUBJ_L SUBJ_O SUBJ_OU SUBJ_CN
```
The preceding command creates `web/mage-web.crt` and `web/mage-web.key`, which
the nginx configuration file references.  The `<(...)` operator is Unix process
substitution and allows treating the enclosed command output as a file.  The
`subjectAltName` and `basicConstraints` arguments are necessary to install the
public certificate, `mage-web.crt`, as a trusted authority on a mobile device.

**IMPORTANT** If you intend to connect to your reverse proxy from a mobile
device or simulator/emulator running the MAGE mobile app, make sure that the
value of the `SUBJ_CN` variable matches the IP address of your MAGE Server
host on your network, or the resolvable host name of the host.  TLS connections
will not succeed if Common Name and Subject Alternative Name fields in the
public certificate do not match the host name.

When running with the reverse proxy and default port settings in the Compose
file, your server will be available at https://localhost:5443.  If you are
connecting from a mobile device on the same network.

### Bind Mounts
The Compose file uses [bind mounts](https://docs.docker.com/storage/bind-mounts/)
for the MongoDB database directory, database log path, and MAGE server
[resources](../README.md#mage-local-media-directory).  By default, the source
paths of those bind mounts are `database/data`, `database/log`, and
`server/resources`, respectively.  You can change the source paths according to
your environment and needs.

With these bind mounts, the MAGE server will retain its data on your host file
system in directories you can explore and manage yourself.  For example, this
setup allows you to mount a directory into the MAGE server container from a
[FUSE-based](https://github.com/libfuse/libfuse) file system, which might
provide extra functionality like [encryption](https://www.veracrypt.fr) or
[remote mounting](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) transparently to the
Docker container and MAGE application.  If you don't have any requirements of
that sort, you can modify the Compose file to use [Docker-managed volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) instead of bind mounts.

### Ports
The only port the Compose file exposes to the host by default is 4242 on the
`mage-server` service to allow HTTP connections from your host web browser to
the MAGE server running in the Docker container.  In a production environment,
you could add another service in the Compose file to run an
[nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx/) or [httpd](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/)
reverse proxy with TLS or other security measures in front of the MAGE Server
Node application.  In that case you would remove the
```yaml
ports:
  - 4242:4242
```
lines from the Compose file under the `mage-server` service entry.  You would
then most likely add the mapping
```yaml
ports:
  - 443:443
```
to the reverse proxy's service definition.

You can also allow connections from your host to the MongoDB database container
by uncommenting the `ports` block of the `mage-db` service.  You would then be
able to connect directly to the MongoDB database using the `mongo` client on
your host machine to examine or modify the database contents.

### Environment Settings
You can configure the MAGE server Docker app using [environment variables](../README.md#mage-environment-settings).
The Compose file does this by necessity to configure the MongoDB URL for the MAGE server.
```yaml
environment:
    MAGE_MONGO_URL: mongodb://mage-db:27017/magedb
```
