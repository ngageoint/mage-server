## [5.4.2](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/5.4.2)

##### Features

##### Bug Fixes
* Fix login after initial account setup.
* Fix export important, favorite and attachment filters.

##### Features
* Added observation location provider and location accuracy exports.

##### Bug Fixes
* Fixed bug causing observation and location exports to fail.
* Fixed incorrect timestamp when using local timezone for observation and location exports.
* Fixed bug causing incorrect locations to be returned when using time filter and exporting both observations and locations.

## [5.4.0](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/5.4.0)

##### Features
* Added pagination for users, teams, events, devices and layers. This will greatly decrease load times for admin pages on servers with more users.
* Added observation location accuracy.
* Added support in configuration/environment for MongoDB replica sets.

##### Bug Fixes
* Layer panel now properly removes layers when switching events.
* Hide admin icon in navbar for non admin users.

## [5.3.5](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/5.3.5)

##### Features
* Added administrative settings to enable automatic approval of new user accounts and devices.  If you are using a third party authentication strategy 
  where user accounts have already been vetted, you can reduce the barrier to entry into MAGE by using this setting to automatically approve user accounts. 
  In addition you can reduce the device admin approval barrier to entry by automatically approving all new devices.  Administrators can still
  disable devices for any reason, therby removing access to MAGE for that device. 
* Improved map layers panel.  Drag and drop layers to change map z-index, change layer opacity, zoom to layer bounds, and style feature layers.
* GeoPackage upgrade and optimizations.  Feature tiles are now created server side, reducing load on browser.

* Form create modal would sometimes generate an invalid random color.
* Fix bug that could cause iOS GeoPackage downloads to hang.
* Preserve line breaks and whitespace in textarea fields.
