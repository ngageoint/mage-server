All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.
MAGE adheres to [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/).

---

## Pending on [`develop`](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/tree/develop)

##### Features

## [6.2.10](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/6.2.10)

#### Database Migrations
* [SAML settings](./service/src/migrations/030-saml-settings.js)
  This migration modifies documents in the `authenticationconfigurations` collection
  by moving all entries from `settings.options` into `settings` and removing
  the `options` entry.  See the related bug fix below.

#### Features
* Layer file download - The _Layer_ admin web page now includes a button to
  download layer files when applicable.  This currently works only for
  GeoPackage layers.

#### Bug Fixes
* The web app and service incorrectly used a `settings.options` sub-document on
  SAML configurations to read and write some entries that should be in the
  `settings` entry.
* Many third-party dependencies were quite outdated or superfluous.

## [6.2.9](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/6.2.9)

#### Features

- Docker image now installs MAGE packages from NPM registry instead of local tarballs.
- Use a [shrinkwrap](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v9/commands/npm-shrinkwrap) file for consistent `@ngageoint/mage.service` installs.

- The service package did not always install [better-sqlite3](https://www.npmjs.com/package/better-sqlite3), which [GeoPackage](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ngageoint/geopackage) requires to perform operations in the Node.js runtime.

## [6.2.8](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/6.2.8)

#### Features

#### Bug Fixes

- Numeric form field validation failed when the field was required and the
  field value was zero.

## [6.2.7](https://github.com/ngageoint/mage-server/releases/tag/6.2.7)

#### Features

#### Bug Fixes
