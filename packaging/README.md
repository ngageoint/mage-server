# Init Scripts and Build Files

This `pkg` directory contains various init files for server setups. Each is 
named in its own directory.

For example, the `rhel-centos` directory contains a `mage` file. This file
shoudld be placed in the `/etc/init.d/` folder on the server that mage is 
deployed on.
