<div><div cl***REMOVED***="cookbook-page"><p>Welcome to the Angular cookbook. Here we will show you typical uses of Angular by example.</p>
<h2>Hello World</h1>
<p><a href="cookbook/helloworld">Hello World</a>: The simplest possible application that demonstrates the
cl***REMOVED***ic Hello World!</p>
<h1>Basic Form</h1>
<p><a href="cookbook/form">Basic Form</a>: Displaying forms to the user for editing is the bread and butter
of web applications. Angular makes forms easy through bidirectional data binding.</p>
<h1>Advanced Form</h1>
<p><a href="cookbook/advancedform">Advanced Form</a>: Taking the form example to the next level and
providing advanced features such as  dirty detection, form reverting and submit disabling if
validation errors exist.</p>
<h1>Model View Controller</h1>
<p><a href="cookbook/mvc">MVC</a>: Tic-Tac-Toe: Model View Controller (MVC) is a time-tested design pattern
to separate the behavior (JavaScript controller) from the presentation (HTML view). This
separation aids in maintainability and testability of your project.</p>
<h1>Multi-page App and Deep Linking</h1>
<p><a href="cookbook/deeplinking">Deep Linking</a>: An AJAX application never navigates away from the
first page it loads. Instead, it changes the DOM of its single page. Eliminating full-page reloads
is what makes AJAX apps responsive, but it creates a problem in that apps with a single URL
prevent you from emailing links to a particular screen within your application.</p>
<p>Deep linking tries to solve this by changing the URL anchor without reloading a page, thus
allowing you to send links to specific screens in your app.</p>
<h1>Services</h1>
<p><a href="api/ng">Services</a>: Services are long lived objects in your applications that are
available across controllers. A collection of useful ***REMOVED***s are pre-bundled with Angular but you
will likely add your own. Services are initialized using dependency injection, which resolves the
order of initialization. This safeguards you from the perils of global state (a common way to
implement long lived objects).</p>
<h1>External Resources</h2>
<p><a href="cookbook/buzz">Resources</a>: Web applications must be able to communicate with the external
***REMOVED***s to get and update data. Resources are the abstractions of external URLs which are
specially tailored to Angular data binding.</p>
