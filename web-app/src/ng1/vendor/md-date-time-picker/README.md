##Documentation

The Documentation is at [https://puranjayjain.github.io/md-date-time-picker](https://puranjayjain.github.io/md-date-time-picker)

- Opera

Supported versioned browsers:

- Internet Explorer 8+
- Safari 8+
- Mobile Safari 8+
- Android Browser 4.3+

## Dependency

### Moment
Why? because parsing dates correctly is not every browser's cup of :tea: and also according to [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601) standard

Moreover, it makes dealing with timezones easier.

ok. Not satisfied with the answer?

Let's take an example:

```js
  new Date('1/10/2016')
```

What should it output? ... well it is interpreted as 1st October 2016 in some browsers and 10th January 2016 in some.

For more information refer [link](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Date/parse).

### Draggabilly

This is an optional dependency if you want to make the dial draggable in time picker in minute which makes it useful there to select values which are not a divisor of 5 (e.g 3, 6) or in layman terms the values which come between 5, 10, 15, etc.

### Build

To get started modifying the components or the docs, first install the necessary
dependencies, from the root of the project:

```bash
npm install
```

After successfully installing the above components

```bash
./node_modules/gulp default
```

Most changes made to files inside the `src` directory will cause the page to reload. This page can also be loaded up on physical devices thanks to BrowserSync.

## Tests

```bash
$ npm run cs:scss //lint all scss files
$ npm run cs:js //lint and fix all js files
$ npm run cs //run both cs jobs
```
## Versioning

For transparency into our release cycle and in striving to maintain backward
compatibility, this project is maintained under

but we'll adhere to those rules whenever possible.
